1. The benefits of containers often derive from their speed and lightweight nature; many more containers can be put onto a server than onto a traditional VM. VMs and Containers differ on quite a few dimensions, but primarily because containers provide a way to virtualize an OS in order for multiple workloads to run on a single OS instance, whereas with VMs, the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple OS instances. Containersâ€™ speed, agility and portability make them yet another tool to help streamline software development


2. 49160 - docker container port 
   8080 - host 

3. Containers need management. These tools provide:
- Provisioning
- Configuration scripting
- Monitoring
- Rolling upgrades and rollback
- Service discovery

4. kubectl scale [--resource-version=version] [--current-replicas=count] --replicas=COUNT (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME)

5. A 'vertical' deployment is one that requires deploying all tiers and components in order to test any one of them.
A horizontal deployment is one that focuses only on one component or tier. 

6. If an app has a web dyno, and that web dyno receives no traffic in a 30 minute period, the web dyno will sleep. Paid one will not.
