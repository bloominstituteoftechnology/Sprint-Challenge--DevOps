1. Virtual Machines are a sort of imitation of a physical computer. Several of these imitations can be on one physical machine, while remaining independent of each other. Docker uses linux kernals to allow different containers, holding code and dependencies together, to run independently. The benefit to docker is that it would run faster and be less costly as compared to full virtual machines. Docker containers would be more portable.
2. Map between port 8080 in the container and a port on your local machine, port 49160.
3. Container orchestration platforms make working with dockers. They organize and allocate system resources.
4. Update the 'replika' value in the file.
5. Horizontal scaling adds more physical resources to the container. Vertical scaling adds resources to the container, but not the physical structure.
6. The paid versions of Heroku offer considerablly more RAM, more process types (from 1, in the free version, to unlimited in the highest teir), a no sleep feature, and unlimited use, the free tier has a limit of 1000 hours per month.
