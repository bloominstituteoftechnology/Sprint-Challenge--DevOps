### Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using markdown.
<!-- 1)	A Docker container allows you to take your environment with you in a lightweight way while a virtual machine contains an OS and uses more space. A Docker container can provide great portability since it uses said less space and brings a snapshot of the production environment so the code runs as it does on the machine used for testing.
2)	The 49160:8080 specifies that when someone connects to the host on port 49610, they will be routed to port 8080 within the container.
3)	A container orchestration platform manages the scaling of the application when there are more users and provides extra tools to make changes across services in the stack.
4)	Run a command using the kubectl CLI called scale specifying the number of replicas required.
5)	Horizontal scaling is adding more instances or server machines while vertical scaling is adding more power and resources to the machines you already have.
6)	The free tier for the Dyno containers have a limit of 30mins uptime and come with a certain amount of uptime hours, while the paid tiers are always up and have a certain amount of hours of uptime per month to use. -->
